My name is Michael D. Kessler, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow working on bioinformatic and cancer genomic research in the Department of Oncology at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Prior to this position, I studied cancer biology and genome science as a PhD student in Molecular Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.
