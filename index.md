My name is Michael D. Kessler, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow working on bioinformatic and cancer genomic research in the Department of Oncology at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Prior to this position, I studied cancer biology and genome science as a PhD student in Molecular Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. I am currently working on pan cancer and head and neck cancer specific biological data science projects related to transcription factors, super enhancers, alternative splicing, and high throughput drug sensitivity screens. I previously worked on projects related to population genetics and molecular evolution, and my thesis work focused on the application of clinical genomics to human populations with differing ancestral backgrounds. I am interested in applying data driven analysis to translational, financial, and industrial biomedical questions.
